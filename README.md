# Learning x86 assembly

Just for fun, I though I'd learn some assembly. I opted for 32-bit (x86) NASM because asmtutor.com has good resources. I had always planned on starting with a simpler ISA like 8051, z80 or 68k due to suggestions I had read. The lessons on asmtutor start with just a few registers and simple instructions, so the complexity of x86 really isn't a hindrance.

Since I primarily use higher-level, dynamic languages, I find it fascinating and surprisingly enjoyable.
